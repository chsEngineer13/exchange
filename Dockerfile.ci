# This Dockerfile is designed to stand up a ready-to-use Exchange
# (without any of the other required apps - PG, Geoserver, etc)
# It is currently only used for Travis-CI builds, but it should be
# portable enough to work in other situations.

# Testing must happen on CentOS 6.7 per client requirements
FROM centos:6.7

# Get everything we'll need other than our WAR, Exchange code and Python deps.
# Most of this is headers needed during pip install of Python packages with C.
